# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_MachineLearning

Pima Indian Diabetes Prediction

## Abstract:

- This project helps one to gain an understanding of how to perform Machine Learning with Python. 

- First, you will learn how to format your problem to be solvable. 

- Next, you will discover how to prepare your data for use in a prediction. 

- Then, you will understand how to combine that data with algorithms to create models that can predict the future. 

- Finally, you will explore how to evaluate & improve the performance of the solutions you create.

- We will be using Naive Bayes, Random Forest & Logistic Regression algorithms to get the desired results.

## Installation Dependencies:

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn (Scikit-learn)

## Implementation

Pima-Prediction.ipynb file has the detailed solution for Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning.

## How to run?

- First clone the project into your local system
`
git clone https://github.com/Nuclearstar/Diabetes_Prediction_Using_MachineLearning.git
`
- Then change directory to this project
`
cd Diabetes_Prediction_Using_MachineLearning
`
- Then setup a virtual env
`
python -m venv myenv
`
- Then activate your virtual env
```
cd myenv
cd Scripts
activate
```
- Further change directory to project root
```
cd ..
cd ..
```
- Next install all the required packages in the virtual env
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`
- Now you are ready to run the program
`
jupyter notebook
`
