# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_MachineLearning

Pima Indian Diabetes Prediction

## Abstract:

- This project helps one to gain an understanding of how to perform Machine Learning with Python. 

- First, you will learn how to format your problem to be solvable. 

- Next, you will discover how to prepare your data for use in a prediction. 

- Then, you will understand how to combine that data with aalgorithms to create models that can predict the future. 

- Finally, you will explore how to evaluate & improve the performance of the solutions you create.

- We will be using Naive Bayes, Random Forest & Logistic Regression algorithms to get the desired results.

## Installation Dependencies:

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn (Scikit-learn)

## Implementation

Pima-Prediction.ipynb file has the detailed solution for Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning.
